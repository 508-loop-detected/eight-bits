# eight bits

The source of randomness is analog noise. The "random bits" board produces noise, four random voltages, and four random bits which are the result of comparing the random voltages with control voltage. It is designed to be reused in other modules.

This module, like many of my modules, uses 2mm-pitch male/female headers. Be sure you order/use the right thing!
