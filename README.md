# eight bits

<img src="8-bits.jpg" width=600>

Four random gates and their four opposites. Input a clock. Adjust the pots to control the probability of each of the left or right random gates firing -- with every clock tick, either the left or the right will fire.

The source of randomness is analog noise. You get noise, a random stepped voltage, and four random bits which are the result of comparing the random voltages with control voltage. When CV is plugged in to any of the four CV inputs, its pot becomes an attenuator for that CV input. 

The most human-readable BOMs are the ones with `fixed` in front of the name. The other BOMs are the ones generated by the EDA software. You can use them, the gerbers, and the pick-and-place files to order boards pre-populated with [some of] the SMD parts.

This module, like many of my modules, uses 2mm-pitch male/female headers. Be sure you order/use the right thing!

Generally speaking, most ICs are SOIC 8/14/16, and all passives are 0805.
